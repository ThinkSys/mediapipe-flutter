# ThinkSys Mediapipe Plugin

The ThinkSys Mediapipe Plugin brings pose detection to Flutter apps, filling a gap for iOS developers. It offers real-time tracking, easy integration, and customizable options for fitness and healthcare apps. By connecting MediaPipe's capabilities with Flutter's framework, we're enabling developers to build engaging, motion-based iOS apps easily.

## Usage

### Basic Usage
For basic usage of the PoseLandmarks widget without any props:

```
import 'package:thinksys_mediapipe_plugin/pose_detection.dart';

PoseLandmarks(
  key: UniqueKey(),
)

```
### Usage with Camera Facing Option

To specify which camera to use (front or back):

```

PoseLandmarks(
  key: UniqueKey(),
  cameraFacing: CameraFacing.front,
)

```
### Usage with Orientation Handling

To handle orientation changes (portrait or landscape):

```

PoseLandmarks(
  key: UniqueKey(),
  options: PoseLandmarkOptions(
    cameraOrientation: orientation == Orientation.portrait
        ? CameraOrientation.portrait
        : CameraOrientation.landscape,
  ),
)

```
### Usage with Body Properties

To customize which body parts are tracked using properties like face, leftArm, rightLeg, etc.:

```

PoseLandmarks(
  key: UniqueKey(),
  options: PoseLandmarkOptions(
    face: true,
    leftArm: true,
    rightArm: true,
    leftLeg: true,
    rightLeg: true,
    torso: true,
  ),
)

```
### Usage with onLandmark Properties

To capture and process the pose landmarks detected:

````
PoseLandmarks(
  key: UniqueKey(),
  options: PoseLandmarkOptions(
    poseLandmarks: (value) {
      print("Received Landmarks: $value");
    },
  ),
)

````
