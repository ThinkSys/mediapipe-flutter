# ThinkSys Mediapipe Plugin

The ThinkSys Mediapipe Plugin brings pose detection to Flutter apps, filling a gap for iOS developers. It offers real-time tracking, easy integration, and customizable options for fitness and healthcare apps. By connecting MediaPipe's capabilities with Flutter's framework, we're enabling developers to build engaging, motion-based iOS apps easily.

    rightLeg: false,
    leftArm: true,
    rightArm: true,
